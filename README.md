# Economics undergraduate Year 3

### Education
B.Soc.Sci Economics Minor in Math & Business Analytic (most likely) 

CGPA: 3.24 *At least we dont have grade inflation ...

### Miscellaneous
Technical skills: Python, Stata, LaTeX (proficient); R, SAS, Z-tree (working knowledge)

Languages: Chinese, Cantonese (native), English (full proficiency, more often for f-bombs)


- Courses with really good grades: Adv Micro, Machine learning Project and Most of the math courses
- Courses I fked up: Adv Macro, Mathematical Econ

### Research Interest

My current research interest relies on mechanism design. I am now orgainzing field experiment in education.

**Self-motivated Learning**
*Although prevailing research suggest SEN are generally under-preforming in schools (compared with normal students), I argue such academic gaps is mainly contributed by the non-schooling hours. For example, children’s self-motivation on revision and their efforts in doing assignments or reading books under an unsupervised environment. Before the formal experiment, our trail experiment suggested that increasing in supervised schooling hours (through private education), would also increase the devoted hour in self-motivated learning. I believe that our experiment would generate similar results. The second part of the paper focuses on self-motivated learning. I examine two indicators, frequency of unsupervised learning activities as cognitive ‘self-control’, and quality of work over specific period of time for ‘cognitive endurance’ as the ability to sustain performance over time during an activity that requires effortful thinking, to measure assignment quality. Two indicators are important for measuring the input devote and marginal output (the academic results) and explain how SEN are in disadvantage from a much quantitative perspective.*

**Optimal Schooling Hours, Quality Sleeping and Diminishing Marginal Return**
*I compare three different arrangements of schooling period {(06:00 – 22: 00), (08:00 – 22:00), (06:00 – 20:00)} and to see the impact to children using field experiment in Jinggangshan, China. Details In draft.*

I had wrote serval simple work on NBA and labor market, some are for course work.

1. [‘The Bargain with the Demands: A Review of recent Afghanistan–China Trading Relation,’](https://github.com/PerryThePlatypusPlumber/bio/blob/main/ECON3370%20China.pdf) (policy paper for China econ course)
2. [‘Analyzing productivity Spillovers and ball-Assist Network using deep learning,’](https://github.com/PerryThePlatypusPlumber/bio/blob/main/MachineLeaning_NBA.pdf) (more likely a trail run, the dynamic matrix is really good to my opinion ... code avaliable upon request!)
3. [‘May the best team win?’ Team Bias by NBA referees’](https://github.com/PerryThePlatypusPlumber/bio/blob/main/ECON2901_paper.pdf) (Sophomore year paper, the regression is pretty awful)


### Volunteer Services
- Previous Supervision: Carson Lam (CUHK PACC), Camille  Wang (NUS Econ), Tsz Yuet Yeung (Cityu Data Science), Coe Woo (CUHK, SOWK), Emily Yuen (HKUspace then HKU BA)
- I also wrote many mock exam paper and paper materials for Schools and NGOs, request by e-mail. This years Mock for
